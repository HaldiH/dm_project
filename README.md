## Regression Project : prediction of continuous attributes. (not classification)
- Investigate SVM machines for regression
- Investigate Perceptron algorithm
- Investigate simple linear regression $y = w_0 + w^T \cdot x$
where y is attribute being predicted and cost function
is MSE between errors e.g. $$C(X, Y) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y(X)-y)^2$$
